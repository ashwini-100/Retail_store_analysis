# Retail_store_analysis
Hello everyone,

I am excited to share with you my  Project on Retail Stores Data Analysis! As part of my Capstone project with careerera, I had the opportunity to work on this project and gain valuable insights into analyzing dataset.

In this project, I used Python to analyze Retail Stores data and created visualizations to better understand trends and patterns. I also used machine learning algorithms to make predictions and also compare each alogorithms to find the best model.
I also  use Power BI where i have create different charts and plots which showcase weekly sales with respect to different categories.

I had a great time working on this project and learned a lot in the process. I hope it inspires you to dive into data analysis and explore the insights that can be gained from it.
